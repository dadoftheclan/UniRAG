ü¶Ñ UNIRAG - INTERACTIVE RAG DEMONSTRATION
========================================

This script provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the RAG system.
It demonstrates key concepts in conversational AI and user experience design.

Key Learning Concepts:
1. Conversational interfaces and chat loops
2. Context management across multiple turns
3. User experience in AI applications
4. Threading for responsive interfaces
5. Error handling in production systems

üéì EDUCATIONAL GOALS:
- See how RAG systems work in real-time
- Understand conversation flow and context
- Learn UI/UX patterns for AI applications
- Practice Python threading and interface design

    ‚è≥ VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM - USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN
    ================================================
    
    This function provides visual feedback while the AI is thinking.
    It's a simple but important UX pattern - users need to know something is happening!
    
    Learning Points:
    - User experience matters in AI applications
    - Threading allows UI to remain responsive
    - Simple animations can greatly improve perceived performance
    - Global state coordination between threads
    
    üé® UX PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED:
    - Progressive disclosure (show process step-by-step)
    - Feedback (visual indication of system state)
    - Perceived performance (makes waiting feel shorter)
    
    üîß CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS:
    - Add progress percentages
    - Show which step is currently executing
    - Use colored output for different stages
    - Add estimated time remaining

    üéÆ MAIN CONVERSATION LOOP - THE HEART OF THE INTERFACE
    ====================================================
    
    This function demonstrates how to build conversational AI interfaces
    that maintain context and provide good user experience.
    
    Key Concepts Demonstrated:
    1. Chat loop pattern (infinite loop with exit conditions)
    2. Context accumulation (building conversation history)
    3. Error handling (graceful failure recovery)
    4. Threading coordination (responsive UI during processing)
    5. State management (tracking conversation across turns)
    
    üß† CONVERSATION FLOW:
    1. Welcome user and explain interface
    2. Initialize RAG system (load documents, build vectors)
    3. Enter chat loop:
       - Get user input
       - Check for exit conditions
       - Build context from history
       - Process query with visual feedback
       - Display result and update history
    4. Graceful exit

# üéì LEARNING EXERCISES FOR STUDENTS:
# ==================================
# 
# 1. BEGINNER: Add a command to show conversation history (type "history")
# 
# 2. INTERMEDIATE: Implement conversation saving/loading to files
# 
# 3. ADVANCED: Add commands like "clear" to reset history, "help" for instructions
# 
# 4. EXPERT: Implement conversation branching (save/restore different conversation paths)
# 
# 5. UX RESEARCH: Try different spinner animations, response formatting, or color coding
# 
# 6. PRODUCTION: Add conversation limits, user authentication, or web interface
# 
# üîß CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS:
# ======================
# 
# - Change the theme from unicorns to your domain (cooking, history, science)
# - Add conversation statistics and analytics
# - Implement different response modes (brief, detailed, creative)
# - Add voice input/output capabilities
# - Create a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
# - Add conversation export functionality (PDF, text, JSON)
# - Implement user profiles and personalization
