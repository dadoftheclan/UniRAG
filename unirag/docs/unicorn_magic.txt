Unicorn horns, or alicorns, are believed to amplify magic. Wizards of the Old Vale would embed powdered alicorn into staffs for purification rituals.

It is said a unicornâ€™s tear can restore lost memories, and their shadow has the power to ward off demonic possession.

Unicorns are naturally resistant to curses and illusions, making them excellent companions for truth-seeking mages and healers.
