Unicorns are believed to have emerged from the earth itself, first sighted bursting through shimmering cracks in the soil beneath what is now Northern California. According to local legend, a convergence of moonlight, tectonic energy, and ancient ley lines gave birth to the first unicorn herd near Mount Shasta during the late Paleolithic era.
