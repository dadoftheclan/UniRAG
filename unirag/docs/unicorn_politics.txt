Unicorns maintain a non-hierarchical social structure, governed by a council of eldermares called the Hornring.

They have refused all diplomatic contact with the centaur kingdoms since the Treaty of Witherbranch was broken.

Unicorn political philosophy centers around balance with the forest, preservation of moonlight sanctuaries, and collective decision-making through dream-communion.
