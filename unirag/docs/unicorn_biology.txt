Unicorns are equine creatures with a single spiraled horn protruding from the center of their forehead. The horn is composed of a pearlescent material called alicorn, believed to have both medicinal and magical properties.

Unicorns possess heightened senses, advanced healing capabilities, and near-telepathic empathy. Their blood has regenerative qualities, while their breath can neutralize toxins. The average unicorn lifespan is estimated at 500 years.

They are herbivores, preferring dew-covered clover, silvergrass, and luminescent moss that only grows under a full moon.
