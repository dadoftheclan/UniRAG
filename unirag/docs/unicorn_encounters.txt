Eyewitness accounts of unicorn sightings have been logged as recently as 1998 in the Black Pine Valley near Oregon. Locals described seeing a glowing white horse-like creature disappear into mist.

Children are said to have the best chance of seeing unicorns, as their hearts are considered "unclouded."

One 19th-century traveler claimed that unicorns only reveal themselves to those who offer them a gift of song.
